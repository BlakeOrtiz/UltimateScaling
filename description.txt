Have you ever found a weapon and thought "I really like how this feels!" Yet, one or two bosses later, its damage output is very lacking?

Ultimate Scaling aims to provide your favorite weapons with damage boosts based on your world's progress (How many bosses have been killed) so you can use them longer!

This won't eliminate needing to farm for stronger weapons completely, as doing so is a core aspect of gameplay, but it will give you that extra damage needed to use them just a bit longer!

================================

Compatiblility:

[âœ“] All major content mods

[?] There is a chance that similar mods may conflict and the scaling damage may not match results the player or author's of said mods were expecting.

================================

Known Bugs/Issues:
* None, report any you find, please!

================================

Planned Updates:
* Config values to offer higher/lower boost options for those who want to customize how strong weapons can become.

* Addition of materials that would need to be applied to weapons in order to offer scaling. (Would offer more gameplay rather than just passive scaling. May make this part of the Config so you can turn this feature on or off).

* If you have any ideas feel free to let me know!
